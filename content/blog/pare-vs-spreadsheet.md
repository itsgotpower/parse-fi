If you track your money in a spreadsheet, you already know the appeal: it's yours, it does exactly what you told it to, and no company can change it out from under you. Maybe you built it by hand in Google Sheets, maybe you use Tiller to feed transactions into it automatically for around $79 a year (check their site for the current number). Either way, it's flexible in a way no app quite matches — and it's a small chore you maintain forever. This is an honest look at when the spreadsheet is still the right tool and when an app that builds itself earns its place. We make Pare, so read it with that in mind, but a good spreadsheet is genuinely hard to beat on its own terms.

## The one difference everything else follows from

A spreadsheet is a canvas you maintain. Pare is a tool that builds itself.

With a spreadsheet, you own the layout, the formulas, and the categories, and you keep the whole thing running — importing rows, tagging them, fixing the formula that broke when you added a column. Pare reads the statements you already download and builds the dashboard on import; you don't design it, and you don't maintain it. There's a wrinkle worth naming up front: Tiller feeds your sheet through a bank aggregator, so a Tiller-fed spreadsheet carries the same live-connection-to-your-bank question that any bank-linked app does. A sheet you paste into by hand doesn't, and neither does Pare, which reads statements instead. (We made that whole case in [why we don't connect to your bank](/blog/why-we-dont-connect-to-your-bank).)

## At a glance

| | Pare | Hand-built sheet | Tiller |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ongoing effort | One upload a month | Continuous | Categorising and upkeep |
| Bank login required | No | No | Yes, via aggregator |
| Flexibility | Fixed analysis | Total | Total |
| Analysis built for you | Forecast, baseline, subscriptions, net worth | Whatever you build | Whatever you build |
| Price at last check | Free self-hosted; $8/mo hosted | Free | ~$79/yr |
| Portability | One SQLite file | A file, fully vendor-free | The sheet stays yours |
| Ask Claude about it | Yes — built-in MCP server | Not directly | Not directly |

## Effort

This is the axis that usually decides it. A spreadsheet is ongoing work by design — even Tiller's automatic feed still leaves you categorizing rows and tending formulas, and a hand-rolled sheet is all upkeep. That's not a flaw; for some people the tending *is* the relationship they want with their money.

Pare front-loads all of that into the parser. Drop in a statement and it reads every transaction, categorizes it with rules you can edit, and builds the trends — a few hundred transactions handled in seconds instead of a few hundred dropdowns. The monthly cost is a single upload, not an afternoon of maintenance.

Think about what the upkeep actually is, month to month: importing or pasting the new rows, fixing the ones that landed in the wrong category, checking that a bank didn't change its export format and quietly break a column, and occasionally repairing a formula whose logic you've forgotten. None of it is hard. All of it is time, and it's time that recurs forever — a spreadsheet is never "done."

## Ownership

Here's where the spreadsheet is genuinely unbeatable. A plain Google Sheet or Excel file is about as vendor-free as software gets — it's just a file, readable in a dozen programs, with no company in the loop at all. If ultimate portability is your priority, a hand-rolled spreadsheet is the strongest answer there is. (Tiller is a subscription, so the automatic feed stops when you stop paying — but the sheet it built stays yours.)

Pare is built on the same instinct: everything lands in a single SQLite file on the machine running Pare, which you can copy, inspect, or take with you. It's one file you own, same as the spreadsheet — just one you didn't have to build.

## Flexibility vs. built-in analysis

The spreadsheet wins flexibility, flatly. Any calculation you can imagine, any layout, total control — if you want a bespoke formula for your exact situation, nothing beats a cell you write yourself.

Pare wins on the analysis you'd otherwise have to build and maintain by hand: cash-flow forecasts 30/60/90 days out, a discretionary "baseline" that strips one-off charges, net-worth history, subscription and double-bill detection, a money-flow view of where each month goes, and a daily-spend heatmap. You *could* construct some of that in Sheets — but it's a weekend to build and a standing chore to keep working. Take the forecast as an example: to answer "will my balance dip below zero before payday?" in a spreadsheet, you'd model recurring income, scheduled bills, and typical discretionary spend, then keep all of it current as life changes. Pare projects that from your latest reconciled balance without you building anything — and it's the kind of question you want answered on a Tuesday, not the kind you want to maintain a model for. And Pare adds one thing a spreadsheet can't: a local MCP server that lets you ask Claude about your numbers in plain language.

## Getting your spreadsheet into Pare

One honest note on migration, because it takes a step. Pare imports from statements — drop in your PDF or OFX/QFX files and it parses them. If your history happens to be in a Monarch, Mint, or YNAB export, Pare's importer reads those directly. But a raw Tiller or Google Sheets CSV isn't auto-detected — Pare doesn't have a spreadsheet-specific importer, so the reliable path in is your bank statements, with the spreadsheet kept as a reference while you re-tag. If most of your value is in a custom sheet you've tuned for years, that's a real cost to weigh.

## Where the spreadsheet wins

Keep the spreadsheet if control is the point. If you've built a system that fits your life exactly, if you like writing the formulas, or if a plain file with zero vendor is non-negotiable for you, no app is going to be "better" — it'll just be different, and you'll miss the control. That's a legitimate place to land, and plenty of careful people never leave it.

## The hybrid a lot of people land on

You don't have to pick a side, and plenty of people don't. A common setup: keep a lean spreadsheet for the few things you genuinely want hand-built — a custom savings model, a specific tax calculation, a net-worth tab you've tuned for years — and let Pare do the heavy, repetitive analysis on your statements. The spreadsheet stops being the place you track every transaction and becomes the place you keep the handful of custom numbers a general tool won't compute for you. You get the control where control actually matters, and skip the maintenance where it doesn't.

## Who should pick which

Stick with your **spreadsheet** if the maintenance is fine by you, you want total control over every calculation, or vendor-free portability matters more than anything.

Try **Pare** if the upkeep is the part you dread — if you'd rather drop a statement once a month and get forecasts, baselines, and subscription alerts without building or tending any of it. The two aren't even really enemies: some people keep a lean spreadsheet for a couple of custom numbers and let Pare do the heavy analysis on the side.
