faq:
  - q: "Is Pare a YNAB alternative?"
    a: "Not really a replacement — they solve different problems. YNAB is a forward-looking, every-dollar budgeting method; Pare is backward-looking statement analysis that also forecasts. Many people use both: YNAB to run the plan, Pare to audit reality and own the record."
  - q: "Does Pare do envelope budgeting like YNAB?"
    a: "No. Pare has monthly per-category spending limits with progress bars — a guardrail on top of analysis, not a zero-based, every-dollar envelope system. If enforcing a budget in the moment is your need, YNAB is built for that."
  - q: "Should I use YNAB or Pare?"
    a: "Pick YNAB if your problem is behavioral and you want a system that makes you decide before spending. Pick Pare if you mostly want to understand your spending, forecast cash flow, keep an honest record, and avoid connecting your bank. Use both if you want the plan and a private audit of it."

People ask "Pare or YNAB?" the way they'd ask "hammer or screwdriver?" — and the honest answer is that they're built for different jobs. YNAB is a method for deciding what your money will do before you spend it. Pare is a tool for understanding what your money actually did after the fact. If someone tells you one is simply better than the other, they're skipping the only question that matters: which problem are you trying to solve?

## YNAB is a budgeting philosophy with software attached

YNAB — You Need A Budget — isn't really "an app that has budgets." It's a method, taught relentlessly through four rules, with software built to enforce it. The core idea is zero-based, envelope-style budgeting: every dollar you have gets a job *now*, assigned to a category before it's spent. You budget the money you currently have, not the money you expect. When you overspend one envelope, you have to move money out of another and feel it.

That forward-looking, every-dollar discipline is the whole point. People who click with YNAB often describe it as the thing that finally changed their behavior, not just their spreadsheets. It's proactive by design.

YNAB also connects to your bank (through an aggregator) to import transactions, and it's a paid subscription — roughly $15/month or a bit over $100/year at last check.

## Pare is statement analysis, after the money moves

Pare is pointed the other direction in time. It reads the bank and credit-card statements you already download, parses every transaction, categorizes it with rules you can edit, and builds a picture of what happened: monthly trends, category breakdowns, income vs. spend, a discretionary baseline, net-worth history, subscription detection, and a cash-flow forecast for the weeks ahead.

It's descriptive first. Pare tells you the truth about where your money went and where it's heading if nothing changes — and it does that without connecting to your bank at all. There's no aggregator and no stored login; everything lives in a file on your own machine. (The reasoning behind that is in [why we don't connect to your bank](/blog/why-we-dont-connect-to-your-bank).)

Pare does have *goals* — monthly spending limits per category with progress bars — so there's a light budgeting layer. But it would be dishonest to call that envelope budgeting. It's a guardrail on top of analysis, not a system for assigning every dollar a job before you spend it.

## The paradigm gap, stated plainly

Put the two next to each other and the difference is about time:

- **YNAB looks forward.** Decide, then spend. The value is in the decision you make before the money leaves.
- **Pare looks back, then projects.** Observe what happened, understand the pattern, and forecast where it leads. The value is in seeing clearly.

You can absolutely use both, and some people do: YNAB to run the plan, Pare to audit reality against it and keep an honest, private record you actually own. They're adjacent tools, not rivals fighting over the same square foot.

## How to actually run both

If the two-tool idea appeals to you, here's a concrete way it works without turning into a chore. Use YNAB the way it's meant to be used — day to day, assigning dollars, making the in-the-moment decisions. That's the active layer, and it needs the live transaction feed to do its job.

Then, once a month, use Pare for the review. Drop in the month's statements and look at what actually happened: net cash flow, which categories moved, whether any subscriptions crept up, and where your balance is heading over the next 90 days. YNAB tells you the plan; Pare tells you the truth about how the plan survived contact with real life, and keeps that truth in a file you own rather than a subscription you rent.

The division of labor is clean: YNAB is your steering wheel, Pare is your rear-view mirror and your fuel gauge. One is about the decision you're making right now; the other is about understanding the road you've already driven and the one ahead. We describe that monthly Pare habit in detail in [the 10-minute monthly review](/blog/the-10-minute-monthly-review) — it's built to sit on top of whatever budgeting method you already use.

## Where YNAB wins, flatly

Here's the concession, and it's a big one for the right person. **If your actual problem is behavior — you overspend, you don't know where the month went, you want a system that forces a decision on every dollar — YNAB is better at that than Pare, and it isn't close.** Pare will show you, in clean charts, that you spent too much on takeout. YNAB is designed to stop you before you do it. Analysis and a monthly limit are not the same as a method that changes how you spend in the moment.

YNAB also has years of teaching, a large community, and a genuinely effective philosophy behind it. If you need to be *coached into a habit*, that's a real product feature, and Pare doesn't try to be that. There's a whole ecosystem — videos, workshops, a subreddit — dedicated to making the method stick, and for people who've bounced off budgeting before, that support is often the difference between a tool they use and a tool they abandon in February.

## Where Pare wins

Pare wins on the axes YNAB was never built for:

- **No bank login.** You don't hand your login to an aggregator to use Pare. YNAB's model depends on that connection.
- **Ownership.** Your data is a file you hold, not a subscription-gated cloud account. You can self-host the whole thing from [open-source code](https://github.com/itsgotpower/pare).
- **Understanding over enforcement.** Forecasts, net-worth history, a discretionary baseline that strips one-off charges, subscription and double-bill detection — the analytical picture is deeper.
- **Ask it questions.** A local MCP server lets you ask Claude about your own numbers in plain language, with the data staying on your machine.

And Pare is free to run yourself, versus YNAB's subscription — though again, YNAB's price buys coaching and a method, which is a fair trade for the people who need it.

## When to pick which

Pick **YNAB** if:

- Your problem is behavioral and you want a system that makes you decide before you spend.
- Zero-based, every-dollar budgeting appeals to you and you'll stick with the method.
- You're fine with a subscription and a bank connection in exchange for that discipline.

Pick **Pare** if:

- You mostly want to *understand* your spending, forecast cash flow, and keep an honest record.
- You don't want to connect your bank to anything, and you want to own your data.
- A per-category monthly limit is enough of a guardrail for you.

Use **both** if you want the plan and the honest, private audit of whether you stuck to it.

## The bottom line

YNAB and Pare aren't competitors so much as two answers to two different questions. "How do I decide what my money does?" is YNAB. "What did my money actually do, and where is it going?" is Pare. Figure out which question is keeping you up at night and the choice makes itself.
