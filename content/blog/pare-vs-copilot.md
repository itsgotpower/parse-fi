Copilot is the best-looking money app on the App Store, and if you pay for it you probably like it — the design, the smart categorization, the way it feels genuinely native on your iPhone. Two things tend to nag anyway: it runs only on Apple hardware, and to work at all it needs a live connection to your bank through a data aggregator. This is a head-to-head on where Pare and Copilot actually differ. We make Pare, so read it with that in mind — but Copilot is a good product, and we'll be clear about where it wins.

## The one difference everything else follows from

Copilot connects to your bank. Pare reads your statements.

Copilot uses an aggregator (Plaid) to pull your transactions automatically, and it lives on Apple platforms as a polished iOS and Mac app. Pare is statements-first: you drop in the PDF or OFX statements you already download, and it parses, categorizes, and charts them — in any browser, on any operating system, or on a server you run yourself. There's an optional SimpleFIN sync if you'd rather not hand-feed an account, but it's off by default and you pay the bridge directly, so Pare never sees your bank login. Almost everything below follows from that one split. We made the full case for the statement-first approach in [why we don't connect to your bank](/blog/why-we-dont-connect-to-your-bank).

## At a glance

## Pricing

Copilot is subscription-only — around **$95/year**, or about $13/month if you pay monthly (check their site for the current number). There's a trial, but no free tier: when it ends, you subscribe or you lose access.

Pare is **free to start**. Run it yourself from the open-source code and it's free, full stop. The hosted version has a free tier, with paid plans if you outgrow its caps — current numbers are on the [pricing page](/pricing). There's no card to try it.

That gap isn't automatically Pare's win, though. A subscription funds a team that keeps aggregator connections working across thousands of banks and ships the native apps. Free-and-self-hosted means trading money for a little setup and a monthly upload. Pick the currency you'd rather spend.

## Platform: this is Copilot's home turf

Copilot is Apple-only, and it uses that constraint well. The apps are fast, the design is careful, and it leans on things a cross-platform web app doesn't match today — widgets, native notifications, the general feel of software built for one place.

Pare goes the other way. It's a web app that runs anywhere there's a browser, plus a codebase you can self-host. If you're on Android, Windows, or Linux, Copilot isn't an option at all and Pare is. If you live entirely inside Apple's world and want the most polished native experience, that's a real point for Copilot, and we're not going to talk you out of it. Pare installs as a PWA, so it sits on a phone home screen and works offline for reading — but a native app it is not, yet.

## Data ownership

Copilot keeps your history on its servers, reachable through an aggregator's standing connection to your bank. It's a paid app, so you're the customer rather than the product — but the data still lives with a company, and closing your account means trusting that it's actually deleted.

With Pare, everything lands in a single SQLite file on the machine running Pare. Want to back it up, inspect it, or leave? It's one file you already hold. That's the difference between renting a view of your data and owning it outright.

## Where the feature sets diverge

Both apps cover the core: transactions, categories you can edit, spending trends, net worth, and recurring-charge detection. Here's where they pull apart.

Copilot leans into what a live connection and a native platform make possible: real-time balances, a genuinely excellent mobile experience, and slick in-app intelligence.

Pare leans into analysis of the statements it holds:

- Cash-flow forecasting 30, 60, and 90 days out from your latest reconciled balance.
- A discretionary "baseline" that strips out big one-off charges so you see your real month-to-month spending.
- A daily-spend heatmap and a money-flow view of where each month's income actually goes.
- Subscription, price-hike, and double-bill detection.
- A local MCP server, so you can ask Claude about your own numbers in plain language — "what did I spend on restaurants in Q1?" — without your data leaving the machine. (More on that in [ask Claude about your money](/blog/ask-claude-about-your-money).)

## Categorization and corrections

Both apps auto-categorize on import, and both let you fix what they get wrong — that's table stakes now. The difference is what a correction *is*. Copilot learns from your edits with on-device intelligence, and it's genuinely slick. Pare turns a correction into an editable rule: fix a merchant once and it writes a keyword rule you can see, tweak, or delete, and you can re-apply your full rule set across your whole history on demand. It's less magic and more a visible list of rules — which is the point, if you're the kind of person who'd rather know exactly why something landed in "dining" and be able to change the reason, not just the result. Those rules also survive a full data wipe, so re-importing from scratch doesn't cost you the tuning you've already done.

## What Copilot does that Pare doesn't

Now the concession, because a comparison that pretends Pare wins everything isn't worth your time.

**Copilot's design and native apps are ahead.** This is the whole reason people love it, and it's not close. If a beautiful, fast, native app is the job you're hiring for, Copilot does that better than a web app can today.

**The automatic feed is a real feature.** If you have a dozen accounts and the thought of downloading a dozen statements makes you close the tab, Copilot's automatic feed is the honest answer to your problem.

**Checking on the go is smoother.** Most people check their money on a phone. Copilot is built for exactly that moment; Pare is catching up on it.

## Who should pick which

Choose **Copilot** if you're all-in on Apple, you want the most polished native experience, you'd rather a feed update itself than spend a few minutes a month on uploads, and real-time balances on your phone are the core job.

Choose **Pare** if you want your data in a file you own or you want to self-host, you'd rather not give any third party a live line into your bank, you're on a platform Copilot doesn't serve, or you want to ask an AI assistant about your spending without shipping your finances off to do it — and you're fine downloading statements once a month in exchange.

Neither is objectively correct. If the ownership argument lands, the practical next step is getting your history out of Copilot — our [switching guide](/blog/how-to-leave-mint-monarch-copilot) walks through the export, and once you're set up, [the 10-minute monthly review](/blog/the-10-minute-monthly-review) is the habit that makes a statement-based tool pay off.
