faq:
  - q: "Is Pare a good Monarch Money alternative?"
    a: "If you want to own your data and avoid a live bank connection, yes. Pare reads statements locally and keeps everything in a file you hold. If you need automatic sync, shared-household budgeting, or mature mobile apps, Monarch is honestly the better pick."
  - q: "How much does Monarch cost compared to Pare?"
    a: "Monarch is subscription-only, around $14.99/month or roughly $100/year at last check. Pare is free to self-host and $72/year hosted, with a free tier. Verify Monarch's current price on their site."
  - q: "When is Monarch the better choice?"
    a: "When you want balances that update themselves, you and a partner share one collaborative budget, or real-time budgeting is the core job — and you're comfortable with an aggregator holding a connection to your bank."

If you're reading this, you're probably paying Monarch about a hundred dollars a year and wondering whether the subscription is worth it — or you left Mint, landed on Monarch because everyone recommended it, and something about handing over your bank login still nags at you. This is a head-to-head on the parts that actually differ. It's written by the people who make Pare, so read it with that in mind, but we've tried to be fair about where Monarch wins.

## The one difference everything else follows from

Monarch connects to your bank. Pare reads your statements.

Monarch uses aggregators (Plaid and MX) to pull your transactions automatically. You link your accounts once, and the feed updates itself. Pare is statements-first — you download the PDF or OFX statements you already get and drop them in, and Pare parses, categorizes, and charts them locally. There is an optional SimpleFIN sync for accounts you'd rather not hand-feed, but it's off by default and built the same way around: you pay the bridge directly, and Pare never sees your bank login.

Almost every other difference in this comparison is downstream of that one choice, so it's worth being clear about the trade before the feature grid: Monarch buys you automation at the cost of a live line into your accounts held by a third party. Pare buys you privacy and ownership at the cost of a few minutes a month. We made the full case for the statement-first approach in [why we don't connect to your bank](/blog/why-we-dont-connect-to-your-bank).

## Pricing

Monarch is subscription-only — around **$14.99/month, or roughly $100/year** if you pay annually (check their site for the current number). There's a trial, but there is no free tier; when it ends, you pay or you lose access.

Pare is **free to start**. Run it yourself from the open-source code and it's free, full stop — it's your machine and your database. The hosted version has a free tier, with paid plans if you outgrow its caps — current numbers are on the [pricing page](/pricing). There's no credit card to try it.

That's not automatically a point for Pare. A subscription funds a company that keeps the aggregator connections working across thousands of banks, staffs support, and ships features. Free-and-self-hosted means you're trading money for a little setup and the manual upload. Pick the currency you'd rather spend.

## Data ownership

With Monarch, your financial history lives on Monarch's servers, reachable through an aggregator that also holds a connection to your bank. Monarch's privacy terms are better than Mint's ever were — it's a paid product, so you're the customer rather than the inventory — but the data still sits with a company, and closing your account means trusting that it's actually deleted.

With Pare, everything lands in a single SQLite file on the machine running Pare. No aggregator, no stored bank password. Want to back it up, inspect it, or leave? It's one file you already have. This is the difference between renting visibility into your data and owning it outright.

## Self-hosting

Monarch is a hosted service. There is no version you run yourself; you use their cloud or you don't use Monarch.

Pare is open source and self-hostable. If you don't want to trust any hosted service — including ours — you can clone the repo, run it on your own hardware, and the parser, database, and everything else work the same locally. For a certain kind of person that's the whole appeal. For most people it's a nice option they'll never use, and that's fine too.

## Where the feature sets diverge

Both apps cover the core: transactions, categories you can edit, spending trends, net worth, and recurring-charge detection. Here's where they pull apart.

Pare leans into analysis of the statements it has:

- Cash-flow forecasting 30, 60, and 90 days out from your latest reconciled balance.
- A discretionary "baseline" that strips out big one-off charges so you can see your real month-to-month spending.
- A daily-spend heatmap and a money-flow view of where each month's income actually goes.
- Subscription and double-bill detection.
- A local MCP server, so you can ask Claude questions about your own numbers in plain language — "what did I spend on restaurants in Q1?" — without your data leaving the machine.

Monarch leans into the things a live, always-on connection makes possible: real-time balances, a genuinely strong shared-household experience for couples managing money together, and goal tracking tied to live account values.

There's also a quieter difference in what happens if you leave. Monarch is a subscription, so the day you stop paying, you lose the interface to your data — you can export a CSV on the way out, but the running history, the charts, and the tuned categories live in Monarch's product, not yours. With Pare, stopping means nothing: the database is already a file on your machine, and it keeps working whether or not you ever touch the hosted version again. That's not a knock on Monarch's exports, which are fine — it's just the structural difference between renting a view of your data and holding the data itself.

## What Monarch does that Pare doesn't

Here's the honest concession, because pretending Pare wins everything would waste your time.

**Monarch's budgeting is more complete than Pare's.** Monarch has a real budgeting system — category budgets with rollover, flexible vs. fixed spending, and a household view built for two people sharing one plan. Pare has *monthly goals*: per-category spending limits with progress bars, which are genuinely useful for "am I over on dining this month," but they are not a full envelope or zero-based budget, and there's no rollover or shared-household mode. If your primary need is collaborative, forward-looking budgeting, Monarch is straightforwardly better at it today.

And the automatic sync is a real feature, not just a convenience. If you have a dozen accounts and the thought of downloading a dozen statements makes you close the tab, Monarch's feed is the honest answer to your problem.

**Monarch's mobile apps are more mature, too.** Monarch has polished iOS and Android apps you can check anywhere. Pare is a web app today, with a native mobile app still ahead of it. If most of your money-checking happens on a phone on the couch, that gap is real and worth weighing.

## When Monarch is the right pick

Choose Monarch if:

- You want balances that update on their own and you're comfortable with an aggregator holding that connection.
- You and a partner share finances and want one collaborative budget.
- You'd rather pay a subscription than spend a few minutes a month on uploads.
- Real-time budgeting is the core job you're hiring the app for.

Choose Pare if:

- You'd rather not give any third party a live line into your bank.
- You want your financial data in a file you own, or you want to self-host.
- You're fine downloading statements once a month in exchange for that.
- You care more about understanding where your money went than about live balances, and you'd like to ask an AI assistant about your spending without shipping your data off to do it.

## The bottom line

Monarch is a well-made subscription app for people who want automation and shared budgeting and accept an aggregator to get them. Pare is for people who want ownership and privacy and will trade a little manual effort for it. Neither is objectively correct.

If the ownership argument lands, the practical next step is getting your history out of Monarch — we wrote a [switching guide](/blog/how-to-leave-mint-monarch-copilot) that walks through the export. And once you're set up, [the 10-minute monthly review](/blog/the-10-minute-monthly-review) is the habit that makes a statement-based tool pay off. Hosted signup is open — [create an account](/login) whenever you're ready.
